## Applicability
These terms (the "Terms") govern the relationship between [org-name] (hereafter referred to as "we", "us", or "[org-name]") and you (also referred to as the "Researcher"). By accepting these Terms, you agree to be bound by them.

## Definition of Researcher
A Researcher is defined as an ethical hacker or security researcher who voluntarily aids companies and other organizations in identifying bugs and vulnerabilities within their computer systems, networks, websites, or web platforms.

## Obligations of the Researcher
If you accept an assignment from us, you will receive a briefing from us or our client (the "Client") detailing the scope of your security and vulnerability assessment. You must adhere strictly to this briefing and stay within the defined scope.

You represent and warrant that your activities, reports regarding bugs and vulnerabilities (the "Vulnerability Reports"), and any use of these reports by the Client will not infringe upon, misappropriate, or violate any third party's intellectual property rights, rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

## Confidentiality
You agree that all information obtained during your services or otherwise, including but not limited to any bugs and vulnerabilities discovered, is to be treated as strictly confidential. Specifically, you agree to:

- Treat all such information as strictly confidential.
- Not disclose the information to any party other than us without our prior written consent.
- Not copy, reproduce, or reduce to writing any part of the information except as may be reasonably necessary for providing your services.
- Not use, reproduce, transform, or store any of the information in an externally accessible computer or electronic information retrieval system, or transmit it in any form or by any means outside our usual place of business.

This Confidentiality clause does not apply to researchers reporting vulnerabilities as part of a Responsible Disclosure/Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process. We, however, request that you exercise common sense and consider the sensitive nature of publicly disclosing such information.

## Indemnification
You hereby indemnify and hold us harmless against any claims, actions, demands, liabilities, losses, or damages, whether brought by the Client or a third party, arising from any wrongful acts or omissions, negligence, or willful misconduct on your part in the performance of your services.

## License
By making any Vulnerability Report available to a Client through us, you grant us and the Client a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, reproduce, display, modify, adapt, transmit, and distribute copies of that Vulnerability Report.

## Terms Applicable to Use of the Services
You must be of legal age to form a binding contract to use the Services. If you are a minor (in most countries, under 18 years old), your parents must agree to these Terms on your behalf.

If you agree to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization or entity and bind it to these Terms.

## Privacy
You consent to the collection and use of certain personal information as set forth in the Privacy Policy. Please review those provisions. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy. [org-name] will only use personal information in accordance with its Privacy Policy.

Please note that we:

- Review/check personal information through an ID verification check.
- Review your track record through an internet background check.
- Check your presence on international (terrorism) wanted lists.

## Payment of Rewards
[org-name] offers the possibility to pay rewards to you if you file a Vulnerability Report on the [org-name] platform. Our Clients decide if they want to pay a reward and the exact amount per Vulnerability Report. [org-name] can only pay you if your address and payment details are verified.

## Amendment and Acceptance
The Terms may be modified from time to time upon notification on the [org-name] platform. Continued use of the Services by the Researcher will constitute acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Terms.

## Jurisdiction and Choice of Law
Dutch law applies to these Terms & Conditions for Researchers. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in a court in the Netherlands.
